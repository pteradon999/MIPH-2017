“I’m fine guys, seriously. Aura shielded me!” Ruby said nervously, visibly flinching under worried glances. Well, she tried to flinch which was not an easy task considering numerous bandages on her chest and a cast on her leg.  Her teammates stood near her bed with grim faces. Honestly, she felt terrible and wanted to sleep badly, but her teammates mattered so much more to her right now.
“Ruby, you have three broken ribs, compound leg fracture and concussion. That’s definitely not “fine”. You’ve been stomped by a Paladin!” Weiss was upset. Really upset. 
  She smiled apologetically
“Well, at least you’re all right, guys. And we stopped White Fang, so… yay?!” She tried to improve team mood, but clearly failed to do so. Weiss was furious, Blake looked devastated and Yang… 
   Ruby vaguely remembered that episode almost eight years ago, when Yang dragged her into the forest, hoping to find at least some clues about Ravens whereabouts. They barely survived that day, but she memorised how worried and scared Yang was then. Now she saw that expression again. 
 “Yang… look. Everything is fine. I’ll be fine in a few weeks. I’ll even manage to go to dance!” Ruby forcefully smiled “Don’t worry. You know - what doesn’t kill us, it makes us stronger. And I definitely will be!”
 She took her arm.
“I know Ruby. It’s just… just like that day. I failed to protect my baby sister… again. Everyone’s scared and…”
  her sister looked like she was on a verge of tears. Ruby tightened her grip on Yang’s arm.

“It’s different Yang. I am adult, Huntress-in-Training. Your leader. It was my decision to engage Torchwick. I had my Aura and my weapon with me. It’s just my clumsiness and misfortune. If to blame someone – blame me. It’s not your fault.” Said Ruby with comforting voice, gaining an approving nod from Weiss
Yang sniffed. 
“You really grew up, Ruby.  Mom would be proud.”
Then Weiss scroll started beeping. Heiress immediately unlocked the screen and started reading. It took couple of minutes, while her face slowly changed color from her usual pale to unusual pink. When she finished, she raised her eyes and laughed.
“What happened, Weiss?”
“You know, I remember that time when you wondered – how it feel to be famous. Remember?”
   Ruby nodded. It happened two days before their trip in Forever Fall. Usual night-talk before going to bed. One of many team activities that she managed to think off to know her team better.
  Weiss continued.
“Well, then I must congratulate you. You made on Vale News. I just got the script for tomorrow news”

“Is it supposed to be good or bad news?” Blake sounded nervous.
“It depends. Reporters have a live feed of our fight with Paladin, but Beacon denied them any further information. But some people have signature moves.”
