Worm/Persona 3 crossover 
Summary: Taylor triggers in much worse conditions than in the original, but the outcome is furiously powerful. She gets a contract from the Velvet Room and obtains access to Sea of Souls, but the damage had been dealt, people killed, words said. The world is changing...





Velocity and Assault slowly made their way through the empty hospital corridors, though strictly speaking, it was impossible to call this place a  ‘hospital’. It was a clinic, nothing more. However, it was like a miracle. How could something like this exist in the conditions of such a city as Brockton Bay, where Panacea was actively practicing? Still, it existed.

The place was… dead, and it was the best definition of the state of silent horror that the heroes were experiencing right now. Patients, some medical staff of the hospice, all these people were dead. There were no horror masks on their faces, no broken bodies that could specify a violent end. There was nothing at all. They seemed to have died instantly, as if they had just fallen to the ground and never gotten up. It was terrifying.

Miss Militia and the Armsmaster were in the opposite wing of the building now. That allowed them to cover a bigger radius and to narrow the search for the causes of... this. The Remaining heroes stood in a cordon now, making sure no one could enter… or more importantly, exit. Three minutes from here there also were forces of the New Wave in full strength on a case of unforeseen circumstances. Whatever happened here, the Protectorate could not allow it to get out of this building, otherwise the number of victims could become countless. 

Suddenly, the attention of the heroes was drawn by a strange sound. It was a dreadful mix of a scratch, shout, growl and ten more sounds which they could not recognize in all conscience. But this sound was illogically wrong. Unnatural. Unhuman. Undead.Looking at his partner, Velocity realized that he was not the only one who heard this. Having exchanged glances, the two heroes rushed towards the source of the sound.
  It was small hospital ward in section for hopeless patients. It was a Hospice, after all, but here lay people with most complicated cases, people whose life was completely depended on the life support system. As they approached, the sound grew louder and became more and more unnatural. It would seem that sound was not reflecting from walls, on the contrary - it pierced through them. Velocity felt that his head slowly started to ache. He sighed to himself, being absolutely sure that after this he would be inevitably placed under the Master/Stranger protocol. And he’d be damned if that voice… sound, whatever hell it is has something in slightest similar to that voice of Simurg. 
 At last they reached the door of the ward.
Velocity looked back on Assault.He nodded at the door and prepared for battle. He quietly and slowly opened a door and looked inside. In his superspeed-mode, of course. A moment later he freezed out on a place, falling out of the accelerated status.
 He managed to see a lot of disgusting and terrifying things during his career as a cape. Several years of fight against various threats, from supervillains to Endbringers - the monsters who were capable to destroy whole nations. He remembered what happened in Ellisburg after Nilbog’s madness. But even this life experience was not enough to remain quiet and indifferent in case of a picture he saw.
 It was a small chamber. Even smaller than the rooms in which they had looked in before. Almost all the free space of the chamber was occupied by numerous medical equipment for life support. Apparatus for respiratory support, artificial dialysis, intravenous nutrition from droppers. Dozens of wires and tubes separated from the snow-white apparatus and converged in the center. But the centerpiece of the room was ... Something.
 It... it had a humanoid form, dressed in some sort of army overcoat of some grayish fabric with a red border and metal buttons. On the hands of this creature were immaculately white gloves. In combination with the same immaculate white jackboots and a huge broadsword attached to the belt with a huge golden badge, he would create the image of some military officer... if not for the triangular bone mask with huge teeth and eight coffins that soared under the ceiling, creating a kind of halo .
 The creature paid no attention to Velocity. All attention of the creature’s eye pits was focused on the hospital bed standing in the middle of the ward. Creature's hands, clad in white gloves, smoothly shook the bed back and forth, as if it was shaking a cradle with a baby. The bed creaked plaintively, opposed to the unnaturalness of these movements, but the entity clearly possessed superhuman strength.
 It took a certain amount of effort to allay the trembling and find the strength to transfer the view to the hospital bed. Covered by a thin blanket, a young girl was lying on it.... 
…at least it should have been a young girl.
 But with all of his tact, Velocity ​​could not say that the girl looked good or healthy in any degree.
 Pale face with huge bruise under her only visible eye. Another one was covered with a huge white patch bandage and Velocity seriously doubted that it was done without reason. Many terrible, ugly scars on the entire surface of the hands, as if someone had torn the pieces of meat from her body. Concealed chest, general dystrophy. Velocity ​​did not know what exactly happened here, but looking at the monster that rocked the girl who was at least unconscious, he definitely had some thoughts about what could have caused this.
 Velocity swallowed nervously. It was quite obvious that the cause of everything that happened here was precisely this... being, apparently some kind of Projection. And if his assumptions were correct, then without the participation of the girl, this projection couldn’t be removed.
 Having coped with the emotions, Velocity ​​left the room, carefully closing the door behind him and turned to Assault looking at him. Their exchange of views lasted for a few seconds, after which both simultaneously reached for the radio.
 - Assault - PRT, we found the probable cause of the incident. One of the patients. Little girl, probably trigger, right now she is in coma or something like that, there is a projection hanging above her in a meter, which publishes inhuman sounds. Requesting assistance from Panacea.
 - Understood, Assault. Stay where you are and wait for the Armsmaster and Miss Militia to arrive. You need to make sure that the projection is safe before New Wave allows Panacea to begin treatment.
 - Acknowledged, Assault out.

 Three hours ago.
Her world was like a pile of broken glass. The once solid canvas of her mind was now crushed as if it was broken into tens and thousands of shards, each of those had its sharp and obtuse angles. And putting those pieces together was practically impossible.
 Consciousness returned to her with excruciating pain. The pain was everywhere. Splitting her head, crumbling her legs, burning her skin. Every cell in her body ached and groaned in agony.
 Who is she? How did she get here? What happened? - all these questions surfaced in her pain-filled mind. Her memory now was like a sky puzzle for a thousand details, which a curious three-year-old child scattered around a huge azure-painted room.
 Thinking was painful. Thoughts flowed with the speed of a viscous jelly and did not want to clarify.
 Taylor.
 She remembered. Her name was Taylor Hebert. Was she... fifteen? She had... parents. Yes, she had parents.
 But then…
Then…
Someone died. But who?
Head pierced with pain. More than before. 
Annette!
The one who died was named Annette?
Then her mother died? Right?
The question addressed to her own memory remained unanswered.
 She tried to open her eyes. Muscles... muscles did not obey her, as if rusting mechanisms from long non-use. Her eyelids seemed to be made of the heaviest lead she had ever seen.
 But she kept trying. She continued and her attempts were rewarded with success. Light that she seemed not to have seen for an eternity hit her eyes. One eye to be precise. It was not clear why her second eye saw only darkness.
 Eyes immediately watered, trying to adapt to an abrupt change and her gaze began to blur. Taylor felt that the other feelings begin to return to her.
 First came the hearing. The measured buzz of unknown devices was accompanied by a non-stop squeak of other machines whose purpose she probably knew, but for some reason could not remember.
 The next sense was smelling, immediately catching some strange and slightly harsh smells that surrounded her. And again she could not remember where she was and what this place looked like. As if the associative chain broke off, not reaching the end. The puzzle detail did not want to fall into place.
 All she could see was only a gray ceiling, with some lighters which looked damped for some reason. Body refused to obey her and she could not move at all. Her tongue felt like it has rooted to the top and refused to move.
 Meanwhile, her awakening clearly did not go unnoticed. In any case, her newly-established hearing caught the sound of an opening door and someone's quick steps that approached it. After a few seconds, she felt the upper half of her body begin to rise, as if some kind of mechanism lifted the bed.
 Her eye focused on the man who stood before her. He was a man about forty, with a small beard and brown eyes with thin glasses. A white dressing gown was thrown over his shoulders.
 The man caught her eye and interpreted it correctly.
- Miss Hebert? If you understand me blink twice.
 Taylor fulfilled the request of the man, still not quite aware of what was happening. The man nodded in satisfaction.
- Well. First of all, you are safe. Our department was created specifically for such patients as... - the man continued to say something, but Taylor no longer listened to him.
 Did he say “patients”?
So she is in the hospital? How did she get here?
 Where is father?
What happened?
 Taylor tried to find her latest significant event in her memory. 
Was it January 9th? Typical day. Friday. Lesson with Mr. Gladley. She saw Emma, ​​Sophia and Madison again...
 Emma?
 Sofia?
 Madison?
If earlier her head just hurt, now it seemed as if someone had driven a thousand red-hot nails into her brain all at once and let electric current pass through them in a couple of tens of thousands of volts. 
 Δολοφόνοι *
What was that? Strange words. Strange language. Unfamiliar, unknown. 
Whence? No, what's going on? Why did she think about the Trio, how she...
 Οι εκτελεστές αθώων
Again. This voice. Where is it from? Why does it seems so familiar? Why can't she remember what happened? Where is her father?
 The doctor seemed to understand that something was wrong, as his voice had become sharply restless.
- Miss Hebert, what happened? Please calm down, nothing threatens you!
 Nothing threatens?
And something threatened her?
Yes? Not?
 Why can't she remember?
 Πέθανε
This voice. Is it answering her? She had a feeling that it is telling something important, but she can not understand. She went crazy? But then why doesn't she even understand the voice in her head? Questions. Too many questions in her head and too few answers. 
Why can't she remember?
  Ψυχή σου φώναξε
It really answers to her. Unfamiliar voice. Such... inhuman. Such... Extraterrestrial. But... she knows him. Definitely knows. But from where?
  She must remember. Must.
The pain began to intensify again, which apparently affected the apparatus.
- Miss Hebert, calm down! Sister, sedative in the 314th, quickly! - the doctor almost shouted into a small walkie-talkie attached to a bathrobe.
  Η Θάλασσα των Ψυχών σα άκουσε
Madison. Sofia. Emma. Winslow.
Madison. Sofia. Emma. Winslow.
Madison. Sofia. Emma. Winslow.
Four words. Associative series. Emptiness. Open chain of memories.
   Taylor again stopped seeing anything, the darkness covered her eyes, and the headache increased more and more with each heartbeat.

Winslow. It all comes down to school. She knew that.

Something happened to her. Something bad enough for her to be here.

It must have been them. They did something.
Have done with her.

Trigger
  A revolver drum clicked in her head, replacing an empty nest with a loaded one.
  Ανακαλύψατε [Προορισμός]
Madison. Sofia. Emma. Winslow. Trigger
The puzzle fell into place, the integrity was restored, the picture was assembled from fragments. A headache that tormented her mind in an instant receded, leaving her mind in the crystal clarity of thin crystal.
   She opened her one eye to look into the eyes of the doctor who was now leaning over her. But catching her gaze, he seemed to recoil, turning a little pale.
  Father. She did not see him. The doctor did not say anything about him. She didn't like it.
Was it a premonition?
No. Knowledge.
   Something went wrong.
  She tried to say, but her tongue seemed stuck to the palate, and the tubes in her throat prevented her from speaking.
   But she said. She didn't know how, but she said.
What about my father?
  From the side, her voice seemed to be a dead man's whisper, devoid of emotions and full of some inhuman lifelessness.
“Miss Hebert, your father, he ...” and then the doctor made a fatal mistake that launched a chain of very unpleasant events for many people.
  Dr. Stevenson hesitated.
  Είτε το όνομά μας
- What happened to father? - she repeated her question, not really thinking about how she could speak. It didn't matter. Secondary.
  Danny was more important.
- Listen, Miss Hebert. I don't want to lie to you, but you need to calm down. Now the nurse will come and give you an injection ...
- I must know.
“Miss Hebert ...”
- Tell me!
The doctor sighed.
- Fine. Your father, he ... passed away. Almost three weeks ago.
Tηλεφωνήστε μας
- How did it happen?
- Heart attack. I am very sor.... - Dr. Johnson did not have time to finish his words. The last words in his life. Because at this very moment, Taylor Hebert screamed
[Ανα άτομο]


***
Six hours later. Protectorate Tower. Briefing room.

Emily Piggott tiredly rubbed her nose. Today could hardly be worse.
- So, what do we have at the moment? - she looked in the direction of one of the officers, who was holding a tablet. He got up and clicked on several sensors, leading out information onto the big screen.
- The identity of parahuman discovered by Assault and Velocity ​​is established. - A picture of a young girl with black curly hair and simple black glasses appeared on the screen, - Taylor Hebert, fifteen years old. High School Student Winslow.
- “The one that the Shadow Stalker goes to,” Piggot affirmed the obvious fact. The officer nodded, confirming what the director said. Then he continued:
- Parents: Annette Rose Hebert and Daniel Hebert. Both deceased. Annette died in August 2008 in a car accident, Daniel - two weeks ago, from a heart attack.
“Hebert ... somehow I know that name ...” Jessica Yamada muttered to herself. After thinking for a while she snapped her fingers - was it not him who was the spokesman for the Dockers Union?
“Yes, he was,” the Armsmaster's voice replied through the communication systems. All the heroes of the Protectorate were now connected to the intercom in the hall, and several screens on the far wall broadcasted image from the cameras on their suits. - met him several times while discussing the problem of cleansing the Brockton Bay.
- Enough. - the director stopped unnecessary conversations, returning everyone to the main subject, - what happened to her? Is that really trigger-like situation?
 Officer nodded, continuing the report.
“We have no reliable data on what exactly happened, but with the help of an analysis from Dr. Yamada — the officer showed a psychologist who nodded her thanks — could establish that with a high degree of probability Miss Hebert was systematically subjected to bullying for a very long period of time.
“Miss Yamada, on what basis did you draw your conclusions?” - Piggot switched to a full-time psychologist. Mean hurried to answer.
- I came across a similar events earlier. Her schoolmarks, which were so consistently high, suddenly began to leap, especially for homework for which she received F’s, due to lacking of that homework, moreover, the work performed in the class and not requiring interaction with other students she performed at the same consistently high level. This is not enough, but it is most likely outcome.
 Piggot rubbed her nose again. There always were problems from these teenagers, Wards and their antics were enough for her, and now this Hebert ...
- Thank you, Yamada. So, we suppose, that they bullied her. But what brought her to a coma? She tried to make a conflict with her offenders?
“We don't know that, ma'am.” Four weeks ago, Miss Hebert asked for leave from the second lesson and never returned to class. Six hours later, when classes ended, janitor found Miss Hebert in the back room where the inventory was kept. She was half-dressed and there were obvious signs of sexual violence on her body. Also Miss Hebert was under a pile of biological waste. Judging by the data of criminal examination - various used tampons, garbage and so on. At the time of discovering, the girl’s pulse was traced as filamentous. Paramedics were able to stabilize Miss Hebert’s condition and deliver her to the Brockton Central. There has already been an examination. According to the results, it turned out that Miss Hebert recorded multiple genital ruptures, severe brain concussions, irreparable damage to the left eyeball, three fractured ribs, as well as multiple infectious diseases as a result of which she fell into a coma from which she did not leave until today.
“Why didn't she get an appointment with Panacea and what the hell were she doing in the hospice?” - Miss Militia voice was heard from the intercom.
  The officer nodded.
- Actually an interesting question. As I understood, after the incident, Denny Hebert raised all his connections and cleared out all bank accounts in full to pay for his daughter’s treatment and simultaneously sued Winslow. But it did not work. We managed to find out a little, but apparently they were actively trying to hush up the case. But who - we do not know. The school’s lawyer was Mr Alan Barnes.
- Isn’t that Barnes who achieved a probationary period for Shadow Stalker six months ago? - clarified Piggot. In her mindscape this whole situation right now turned to a very foul-smelling one.
- Yes. It’s him. He works in a law firm that is headed by Brandish - the officer nodded and waited for the Director’s resolution, continued, - Mr. Hebert did not find enough money for a lawyer, because the lion’s share was spent on the maintenance of his daughter, and therefore he had to defend his honor himself. But since the case was clearly not in favor of Winslow, he won, and Winslow undertook to pay for the treatment of Miss Hebert. And everything would be fine if Mr. Hebert did not file a lawsuit a second time, against Mr. Barnes, accusing him of allowing his daughter to mock Miss Hebert.
“Can’t say that was the the smartest step ...” commented one of the Protectorate workers present, but remained unrecognized.
- Forced to agree. This case Mr. Hebert lost, and then received a counterclaim for defamation, which Mr. Barnes immediately won, suing himself a good compensation. As you already understood, the financial condition of Heberts at that moment was far from ideal ...
“And as a result of all this, a heart attack happened ...” Piggot finished gloomily.
- Yes ma'am. Since Mr. Hebert did not leave a will, and Heberts didn’t have any living relatives, a leapfrog began with juvenile responsibility and guardianship, aggravated by paperwork, during which Miss Hebert showed no signs of recovery, so somebody decided for her to be transferred to Saint Brute's Hospice to maintain life support. Where she stayed until today ...
- .. Where she woken up. Without a family, with memories of a trigger, about the circumstances of which I don’t even want to think, and without any particular hope of recovery, do I understand everything correctly? - having waited for a nod, Piggot continued, - gentlemen, I understand this whole situation. But in all this I am interested in two things. Why do I find out about past month events only today? Events which took place in one of Wards schools? And how the hell is Alan Barnes is connected to all of this?
“Actually ...” the officer said.
- Yes? Simmons, do you have anything to say? -  Piggot turned back to the speaker.
“Ma'am ... our men visited the Hebert house. And they found something …”
- Do not torment me, officer.
 Simmons nodded and took from his briefcase a sealed evidence package, inside which lay a thick common notebook. He carefully handed the package to the Director.
“This was in the case of Hebert vs. Barnes as evidence of bullying.”
  She opened the package and removed the notebook to the light. Opening the notebook at an random location, the Director read the notes.
   After ten seconds of reading, she froze. Then she reread the same fragment again.
All this time, her face turned paler and paler, acquiring a painfully white shade.
   Finally, with trembling hands, she put the notebook on the table and looked around at those present.
  - Immediately put all Wards under the M/S protocol. Isolate them at least for a few hours from each other. Armsmaster, escort Shadow Stalker directly to me. And somebody, call Panacea for Hebert girl.
Already leaving the briefing room, Piggot muttered to self
“If only you could forgive us, girl.”

***
Amy Dallon / Panacea
 Despite being rather young, Panacea managed to see such things that even white-haired veterans talk with trembling voice. She saw an Endbringer in his prime, and survived after that. Only for that she could be called a veteran cape.
   Amy has been treating people for almost a year and a half, and during that time she had seen enough to consider herself to be a experienced doctor.
   But this time was different. Everything was different.
It was a completely normal Saturday that Amy wanted to spend with her sister before it went completely wrong.
  She was still in bed when overexcited Vicky crashed in her room. She forced Amy to dress up and escorted to  the rest of the family who were already in their full gear. Twenty minutes later, whole New Wave team was standing on the roof of one of the office buildings, from where a great view of the St. Brutus hospice opened.
   When they arrived the building was already cordoned off by Protectorate response teams, and the Wards in full force roamed around the perimeter.
   As Brandish said during the flight to the rendezvous point, the alarm was raised after the hospital staff abruptly stopped responding to outer world. Repeated calls to reception and numerous attempts to call at least someone did not succeed and people were anxied. Some concerned civilian rushed to see a relative and found only corpses in the reception hall. After that, he immediately called the police. Arriving at the scene cops called PRT

 As a result, the whole Wards team and most of the adult heroes are now gathered here.
   The vivid imagination of Panacea easily painted a picture of the event, which made her feel very uncomfortable. The young heroine firmly associated herself with hospitals.
  Waiting dragged on. The first half hour passed in the painfully tense waiting for reports from the heroes who were inside. There was even more fear in the loud, inhuman sounds which were caught by the microphones even outside the building.
    Then Velocity ​​and Assault managed to find the cause. Amy stayed away from the content of the negotiations, since she did not have direct access to Protectorate frequencies,only adult members were able to maintain that access permanently, but fo Vicky and her -  they were given access only in cases of joint operations.
    As it became clear from the sharp remarks of Brandish, the heroes of the Protectorate needed Amy’s help in order to somehow solve the problem with the parahuman who arranged all this situation. But her mother categorically refused to let her go inside until she had full guarantees of her, Panacea, security.
     Amy had to stay on the roof for almost two hours before guarantees were received and certified by a personal request from Director Piggot. Then Brandish gritting her teeth agreed.
   Panacea was walking along the empty corridors of the hospice, accompanied by an investigator from PRT and her insides were slowly freezing from the sticky feeling of the utter lifelessness filled this place.
 Silence.
Thick, oppressive eerie and impossible silence owned this place. Only rare voices of PRT members were heard in those now empty corridors.
Plants. It was the first thing that caught her eye.Numerous pots were now filled only with dust mixed with gray earth. It looked like every plant here have rotten into nothing. 
And bodies. Wrapped in black cellophane, they lay in straight rows in the main hall. Forty-eight bags. Forty eight people. Forty-eight new graves.
   And they want her to heal the one who did it?
She tried to pull herself together, to recall the Hippocratic Oath and that oath that she gave to herself. Panacea was not holy, she only followed the rules. But after all, every rule has an exception?
   Finally they reached the chamber. Nothing remarkable, except that she was in the wing for patients on life support. Approaching the ward, Panacea nodded slightly to the guardians which were Assault and Velocity, who also nodded grimly at her, letting the girl inside.
   ... And all the words and thoughts that swelled in the head of Panacea instantly disappeared, dissolving inside a much stronger feeling that flooded the mind. All her nature was filled by it in a single moment.
   Horror.
A creature soaring under the ceiling was the embodiment of something antagonistic to her. Unnatural. Something that by a mere existence denied the concept of life.
  Her power, the one that could easily tell her how many cells rot in a human body at that very second, seemed to stop before being hung up in the endless loop which consisted from two words:  “Not life”
   She froze as if she were rooted to the spot and would have stood in this stupor if the hand of Miss Militia, which was also inside the chamber, did not lay on her shoulder.
 - Believe me, we also had this kind of reaction with the Armsmaster. This Projection ... whatever it is - is a rather horrifying thing - an experienced heroine told her.
- B-but you? How are you not afraid? - Panacea asked in a trembling voice, looking at the serious and collected, but not giving and a hint of fear, woman.
Miss Militia raised head and met eyes with Panacea. Panacea trembled. Her eyes were completely lifeless. No fear, no joy, no emotion, nothing.
- Believe, Fear of death was the thing which I had to learn to live with.
   Panacea recoiled from the woman, then squeezed her hands into fists and shook her head decisively, chasing away the obsession. The fear has not gone away - just like nowhere has the creature that now soars under the ceiling has not disappeared, stretching out its inhumanly long hands towards the bed on which her patient apparently rested. With both hands, it touched the head of an unknown girl, barely touching her with the tips of his fingers dressed in white gloves.
   After taking three steps, Amy found herself by the bed of the patient and tooking a deep breath, touched her arm. Second - and knowledge filled her head. Knowledge that immediately astonished her.
   “She is still alive ...” the heroine gasped in shock, widened eyes looking at the medical miracle that now lay before her.
   - What do you mean? - Miss Militia came to her voice.
- Multiple infectious diseases in terminal stages, hepatitis of all three groups, not functioning lung, liver, which theoretically must already be dead, destructed kidneys, numerous blood clots, missing eyeball, damage to the spinal cord. This is only part of a very long list of reasons why she must be dead by now. And she's just in coma.
“Then why is she still alive?”
- It seems to me ... this is - with her free hand she showed at the projection floating in the air, - somehow it keeps her alive. Her heart beats, blood runs through the arteries, and the cells divide, while leaving the telomeres safe and sound. And in terms of biology - this is impossible.
“ Powers are bullshit “  Militia said thoughtfully, lookingat the projection soaring in the air, and continued after a few seconds, “can you help her?”
 Panacea thought for a while before asking:
- What happened to her?
Miss Militia hesitated for a moment before answering.
- This is confidential information, so I’ll get by with general information. It was a trigger. And very unflattering.
 Amy nodded.
- I think I understand. As for help ... my power is not working out of nothing, at least in its normal state. So if she were in standard conditions, even I would be powerless here. Too much damage, too many injuries. But while this, - the girl again showed at the projection, - keeps her alive, I think I can at least stabilize her, removing most of the deadly factors. It will take time, but I have to cope. But on complete recovery? No less than a month. And this is the best prediction that I can give by now.
- Clear. Get down to it - the Militia nodded, tossing the Ka-Bar created by her power into the air.
“It will take time,” Amy warned again, before she sat down in the chair next to the bed and began the treatment.
   She had to remove thirty-seven different fatal diagnosis, 
                                                                       ***
Sophia Hess/Shadow Stalker 

   The fact that something went wrong was understood by Stalker at the very moment when they were all alarmed at eight o'clock on Saturday morning and taken to St. Brutus. Not that this place was somehow noteworthy and interesting for her, yet it was located in the zone of responsibility of New Wave, and there were practically no criminals, and even more so members of gangs, therefore she was not interested in the hunting grounds.
  But like any decent predator, Hess had an animal instinct for danger. And this very instinct made her blood run cold, warning of danger. Sophia trusted her instincts.
   But she could not understand where and what danger could threaten her. Hess was a Hunter and knew how to cover her tracks. And in her humble glance, she did it skillfully. What was even more stranger she had a feeling that she knew from whom danger would emanate. But the thought, like a nimble rabbit all the time slipped from her head, as she tried to grab it by tail.
   Patrolling the grounds were extremely boring. Wards wandered around the perimeter of the building, strictly forbidden to go  inside, trying to prevent possible penetrations. The remaining heroes examined the building from the inside.
   Usually, the Wards served as some kind of entertainment for her. It seemed to her extremely funny to treat these lambs in wolfskins, provoking them to reactions and actions that amused Sofia to some degree. But today,  Wards were even duller than usual. Vista didn’t even try to respond to her caustic comments about how she compensated for her height with space manipulations, and Kid Win didn’t react to her words about the uselessness of his unknown specialization. Hess loved to play on the verge of a foul, but apparently the action taking place inside the building completely killed a spark of fun inside these kids.
Hess straightened crossbows on her belt. She still could not get used to the PRT-made crafts, which were so very different from her previous toys. However, they differed for the better, but Hess was not so stupid as to not understand the number of "surprises" intended primarily for herself, which were inside these tools.
   Three and a half hours spent on her feet made Hess forget about morning runnning exercise.. As if she was not infuriated by the need to be in the “club” in order to hide her heroic activities while studying in Winslow, Hess did not like to laze with workouts.
   Winslow. At that very moment, Sofia smirked under the mask. This school was one of the most successful decisions in her life. Place where she really could be what she deserved to be. Dangerous predator, the queen of the stone jungle.
   The school too valued the preferences that the city gave to institutions where current members of the Wards were schooled in order not to obey the rules that she established. No, no blackmailing or something like that. She just did whatever she wanted, staying within the limits of propriety ... for the most part, and the school ... pretended that everything was going as it ought to be. No more, no less.
   However, sometimes Sophia could not restrain herself and allowed herself a little more than usual. Like in the situation with Hebert girl.
  Oh yes, Hebert.
If an ideal predator existed in her personal world, represented by herself, then Hebert was an ideal victim. Meek, silent, emotional, weak. As if she was specially created so that others could take the upper hand over her.
   She had absolutely everything to turn Hebert's life into hell, thereby satisfying her thirst for playing with prey. She knew everything about poor Taylor, thanks to her faithful snake Emma. Hess really liked to watch  when Barnes strike Hebert into the most painful points with surgical precision, thrusting a poisoned dagger in her back.
   The beauty of betrayal. This is what Stalker admired in Emma. She could not stop being surprised by that endless malice and gloating that Emma could generate when it comes to Hebert.
   Madison was also in her “pride”... but she was only a secondary element,which if necessary, could be... replaceable. But yes, Clements was ... interesting. And if Barnes were a snake, beautiful in her treacherous deadliness, then Madison was a chameleon. Changing the color, merging with the environment, this girl was able to pick up and strike at the moment of maximum weakness, often falling at a critical point.
   Hess, Barns, Clements.
Ebert called them “Trio”. When she thought that no one hears her. One of the few statements in which Sophia agreed with this girl.
   They drove Hebert into a corner, in the sweet anticipation of the moment when she would fight back to break her completely. Like animals circling over a dying muskrat.
   And yet, when the muskrat began to fight back, they were not ready. However, everything went completely wrong from mere beginning
   Strictly speaking, it was Clements idea, once again surprising Sophia with Madison’s perverse ingenuity. Idea to shove Hebert into her own locker was quite old straght from the good 1950’s. But fill her locker with carefully collected biological waste and then lock Hebert in there... that was really something new.
   Something ... if Sophia could have described the idea with the taste, it would be something sweet, with a slight bitterness.
    But the plans remained plans. Reality ... reality turned out to be much more arousing. Making her blood boil fro mere memory of that day.
   For the best effect, they decided that it would be worthwhile to quiet down for a short while, to lie low, to hit Hebert at the moment when she would be completely relaxed. They all agreed with this plan.
   But the victim was too alluring.
Emma could not resist and decided to bite off a piece of wounded flesh that was Hebert's fortitude. She somewhere dug up old photos of Hebert's mother, where she was dressed in the colors of Lustrum's followers, when she was still at large.
   Strike turned out unexpectedly strong. Hebert had a natural hysteria and then she made an unforgivable mistake - the victim attacked the hunter. Barnes was never very sporty, and therefore she cannot seriously withstand Hebert’s attack. Nothing too serious, more catfight, than an actual fight, but bruises and abrasions, as well as the general spoiled look, touched Barnes hard enough to teach Hebert a lesson once and for all. Seeing those bright eyes that Barnes was looking at her, Sophia simply could not resist.
   Madison asked one of her many girl friends to fill Hebert's place with sticky, spoiled juice. When she went to the toilet, they began to act.
   The original plan was to stun Hebert, beat her couple of times, before throwing her into the closet for a couple of hours, but in the process of execution, idea captured them srtongly that they expected. At some time Emma spotted some household items which later were misused. Or maybe not. In the eyes of Sophia Hebert was not much better than garbage. Yes, Hebert girl was already unconscious when they got to the most delicious part, but ...
    Memories of Hebert’s lifeless and indifferent to reality look  will warm her soul for a long time. It was like an orgasm. Someone else's blood was once again on her hands, adrenaline from the realization that she was doing all of this under the nose of the PRT, a feeling of belonging. All this is in earnest agitated her blood.
   Later, when it turned out that Hebert had fallen into a coma, Hess belatedly felt fear that the PRT could launch an investigation, but quickly calmed down and began to act. Forcing Barnes' father to defend school in court was easier than before, and when Hebert Sr. sued Emma, ​​Stalker could not believe her luck at all. Everything worked out, Hebert disappeared, defeated and crushed, leaving real predators to feast on the bones.
    This pleasant stream of memories, which Stalker indulged in the last few tens of minutes, was interrupted by the voice of the Armsmaster in the earpiece.
-  All Wards - immediately return at the HQ. The cry of this creature may have something in common with that of Simurgh. We must be sure that it won’t affect you. On arriving follow the M/S protocol instructions 
 Sophia gasped displeasure. The protocols were pain in the ass. Now she had to spend half a day in a cramped room under supervision, proving to everyone that no cape or power has affected her. Truly hemorrhoids.
   The earpiece in the ear of the Stalker came to life once more, having pre-whined before that, showing that the transmission was only for her.
- Hess, on returning proceed straightly to me and then we go in a straight line to the Director Piggot.
 A chill swept over Stalker's back. The sense of danger has intensified many times.
“May I know the reason, sir?”
“This is related to  Miss Hebert case. She was you schoolmate.”
   The world around Hess froze.
She literally saw in reality how it would seem that separate events stand in one line, forming into the current situation.
   Hebert were in a coma.
St.Brutus is a hospice.
   Hebert could be here.
 Hebert was here.
 Hebert could trigger.
 Hebert  triggered
PRT identified her .Found a case. Raised archives. They found out about Barnes.
   Almost torn thread turned into a steel line that pulls the whole truth to the surface. And if it really comes up ...
  She can not return
She understood it clearly. Crystal clear. There was no plan, no strategy, just instinct. An instinct that even the most powerful of predators must sometimes follow.
   Run
***
An hour after Shadow Stalker escape
Consciousness returned to her as abruptly as it had disappeared. The pain that had so slowly killed her was asleep.
  When she opened her eyes, she faced a triangular, grinning skull, which seemed to opened in a silent scream.
     She should have been frightened.
     But there was no fear.
     Just ... recognition?
    Warmness.
    Recognition
     [Persona]
He took away his hands, before touching her temples and shook with his pale-white skull, making a strange sound like a gurgling. But for some reason she knew that he was glad that she was awake.
 - Miss Ebert, since you have come to your senses, could you remove your ... Projection?
***

“Miss Ebert, since you have come to your senses, could you remove your ... Projection?” - a voice from somewhere beyond her line of sight made Taylor twitch.
      She was agonizing in pain, and her limbs barely moved. It was almost impossible to her head. But almost immediately the headboard of her bed began to rise, giving her better viewing point. At the same time, she felt that the tubes in her throat were removed so she could speak again. Or maybe try to speak
      In addition to [Persona]  there were two more. First was a woman dressed in some kind of military uniform — high army boots, pants and jacket. American flag was wrapped around the waist, same pattern balaclava, covering the lower half of the woman's face.
      It took Taylor about half a second to identify Miss Militia, Brocton Bay Protectorate Member..
      Heroes? Here? In her room?
      But then... they knew her identity! They saw her! Were looking at her right now!
      Madison. Sofia. Emma. «Winslow.» Trigger.
      Everything inside Taylor seemed to freeze. Thoughts, emotions, air in her lung seemed frozen into the solid state
      She felt safe with him here.
      They wanted him gone?
      Make him leave?
      Leave her alone. No protection?
      Madison. Sofia. Emma. «Winslow.» Trigg...
      “No!“  she barely managed to croak, marveling at the weakness of her voice.
      She wanted her voice to be as loud as it was... the last time she saw the doctor. And he... whatever he was, he reacted, opening his terrible wings even wider and uttering a cry that sounded to her as a lullaby.
      She… wanted to feel protected.
      But the reaction to her words was immediate. Some kind of taser appeared in the hands of Miss Milita. Something similar to those things that Taylor saw in the stores on the Broadwalk when she still was trying to find some kind of protection from...
      Madison. Sofia. Emma. «Winslow.»
      They want…
     “Calm down... please”, — came from her right.
      Overcoming the infernal pain in her muscles, Taylor managed to turn her head enough to see the second visitor sitting in her blind spot. Her body was covered by a spacious white hoodie with red medical crosses and schematic symbols of paramedics. A red scarf was tied around her neck, covering the lower part of her face, the upper part was hidden by a deep hood. Sitting next to the couch, she was holding her hand
      Taylor felt as if some spring inside her relaxed for a moment, and the panic attack receded, leaving a nagging feeling of irrational fear…
      But looking at Miss Militia, looking at the weapons in her hands, Taylor realized that she needed to act.
      “I... h-okay. B-but why? He... he makes me feel good.”
      There was a gloomy silence, interrupted by a rare knock of coffins levitating in the air on the ceiling. Militia raised eyebrow, showing a mere degree of surprise at her words. And the gloomily observed:
      “For you - maybe, but the others are... a little uncomfortable. In addition, in order to continue treatment, we will need to move you to another hospital. And with your... projection, that would be... somewhat problematic”.
      That... seemed logical? Taylor heard Ms Milita words  and at the same time did not want to hear them. Some part of her, some important part, denied the idea of being without  [Persona] to protect her.
      Be calm, Daughter of Eve. Let Thanatos go. In a moment of danger... he will come again.
      Again her insides were frozen. But this time it was different. A voice in her head. Not the voice she didn't understand, not the voice that was woven from the howling of the icy winds and the wailing of thousands of souls.
      No. That voice... It was enchanting. Ideal. Every word she heard was like the most beautiful music you hear in the distance and try to remember, but the melody eludes you, leaving you wanting to hear it again. Symphonic utopia, Audio Catharsis - no word would be enough to merely attempt to describe wgat she was hearing inside her head right now.
      Flattery is not the worst of sins, but you have only confirmed the obvious, Daughter of Eve.
      "What... Who are you?!"— she tried to shout mentally — "And maybe I really am crazy".
      No more than the rest of the world, his child. No more. As for who I am — All in due time. Until then, let Thanatos leave your side, it is unnecessary to irritate those... Remnants more then they already are, 
      She... she felt truth in those words. Yes, heroes looked at her, expecting something. He... that Voice, he was telling the truth. But... Why she feel so scared? Why does she think she should let Tan... That's his name? Thanatos?
      She peered into the grinning skull of his. Somehow she knew - there were no face under that mask. Only Nonexictence gathered in material form.
      ...that if she let him go, this nightmare will begin anew...
      Madison. Sofia…
      Do not be Afraid, Daughter of Eve. If these... Remnants betray thou so soon, so Mote It Be. And I Will Come, The Star of Dawn.
      Something... those words were significant. Something... something. It was as if a mere piece of presence that very ancient had leaked through the keyhole.
      "I... H-okay" — she croaked the words before focusing on the... [Gate] mechanism. That was the best description she could give. Like... Like she's the gate. A gateway beyond real world and sowhere. Or someone. And now, concentrating, she could feel the remote control. She was so lame in describing that kind of things.
      With the last whistle, Thanatos disappeared in a motes of blue light, as if shattered, and Taylor felt as if some part of her had returned to its place. And simultaneously with this event her headache, that was tearing her skull from within, virtually disappeared, leaving only fatigue.
      Together with the disappearance of [Persona] heroes visibly relaxed. Weapon in miss Milita hands immedeately disappeared.
      But it was only thing that Taylor saw before she felt  that her eyelids poured lead, and the mind started to float away, plunging her into the Kingdom of Morpheus.
      The last thing she heard was miss Militia's voice.:
      "Panacea, what are you..." — but she was asleep before she heard the ending.
      Sleep well, child. My presence is enough to make some debts pay themselves… 
***

      Miss Militia.
      Watching the cause of mass deaths and the main headache of the day immediately fall asleep after Recalling her projection, Hannah was displeased.
       "Why did you put her down?" she looked at Panacea sitting next to Hebert.
      "Did you see how scared she was when asked to remove her projection?"  Dallon girl asked.
      Miss Militia nodded.
      "She's probably under the influence of her own projection powers, whatever they are, but what's the point?"
      Panacea turned her head, releasing the patient's hand.
      "I don't know how to treat, fix and read minds, but the emotional state is another story. Emotions to me is like a slightly sodden newspaper. I could be wrong in the letters, but the essence will always be correct" There was a bit of pride in her voice. "So, after a request to withdraw her projection she panicked. I don't know who or what she was afraid of, but I had to synthesize a massive dose of sedative right into her bloodstream to calm her down and not order... whatever it was to attack. That's why I decided to put her to sleep, in her waking state she's... unsafe, in my opinion."
      Hannah nodded, agreeing with the reasonable conclusions and fears of the Panacea. In her opinion it would be good to at least try to fish some information from Hebert about this whole incident, but the actions of Dallon girl fully fit within the PRT protocols.
      — Alright. Thank you for your help, Panacea. You may leave. I think in the next few days, PRT will send Brandish a request for your presence in Hebert's treatment.
      When Panacea said goodbye and went out, Hannah touched his ear, activating the radio.
      — Militia to PRT. Projection perished, Mortician is stabilized by the Panacea and ready for transportation.
      A moment later, the radio came alive with an answer
      — PRT to Militia. Understood, transport on your way. 
      
***

      Protectorate tower. Director's office.
      Emily already managed three times regret her words about the day, which cannot become even worse. 
First time — when she learned about the source of extinction in the "St. Brutus".
Second time — when she learned the circumstances of what exactly was Taylor Hebert trigger event. 
And the third time — when she learned that the member of the Wards was somehow responsible for it.
      And now she regretted her words for the fourth time.
      — So, Armsmaster. Am I correct in thinking that after you announced the M-S protocol — you told Hess that I wanted her to come to you, and then you gave her the reason for the meeting, along with the disclosure of information about Cape's civilian identity?
      Armored man didn't move. Thanks to the visor, Piggot could not discern his facial expression. However, this was not needed. She knew her subordinate very well.
       "Ma'am, I'm not…"
      But Piggott interrupted him.
      "Shut up. Colin, it's not my first year at PRT, and yours also. That's my fault I didn't say that Hess could be the cause of Hebert's trigger. But did I have to say that when the entire protectorate Department was on the line? You couldn't put those two facts together? Damn it, Colin, couldn't you wait till the base?
      Armored man once again was silent. However, she was one to blame. Piggot could not but admit that despite the fact that the Armsmaster remained one of the best Tinkers in the service of the Protectorate — sometimes he sorely lacked common sense.
      Taking a deep breath, Piggot continued.:
"And what do we have now? Hebert is a tickling PR bomb. The rhing is that we cannot simply assign KO or put her in a Birdcage without trial. Youth Guard and media will eat us alive. She's not a Canary, still a minor, but with a trigger like that... And now a runaway Hess. How do we explain that one of our Wards going AWOL? What happens if she goes rogue? — Piggott went on to say, already for the most part not paying attention to her standing in front of the Armsmaster, who was more like a piece of furniture. Leaning on it per day required output.
      But in a moment the words ran out, and Emily was finally able to collect the brains in the bunch. Looking at Wallis, Emily, mentally damned that man in front of her. But damage control must be made
      "So. You've made a mess, you're the one who has to deal with it. You go to the Barnes' and do the search. All warrants will be in half an hour. I need ALL the evidence you can find. Next. Stalker, of course, will try lay low, but I doubt that she is so professional to hide everywhere. Analyze where and to whom she could go, you have data on her. I want every CCTV, every drone looking fo her.Find  Shadow Stalker, Colin. We need to get her before anyone gets wind of what's going on here. I'm already accountable to Director Costa Brown for everything that happened today. You understand me?"
      — Yes, ma'am, — the Armsmaster said sullenly.
      — You may be free, — said Piggot.
      As soon as he left the office, the Director picked up the phone and, finding the right number, pressed the call button. There was so much things that needed to be resolved.
